# User Journey Map: Establishing Foundation Architecture for Blockchain & Smart Contracts on Azure

## Persona
- **Role:** Enterprise Architect / Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) Team Member
- **Goal:** Establish a secure, compliant, and scalable Azure foundation that enables blockchain infrastructure and smart contract development.

---

## 1. Discovery & Planning

**Actions:**
- Assess organizational requirements for blockchain adoption and governance.
- Identify stakeholders (security, compliance, development teams).
- Review Azure governance best practices and current templates.

**Pain Points:**
- Navigating Azure’s evolving governance models.
- Aligning blockchain needs with enterprise compliance.

**Outcomes:**
- Clear list of requirements for blockchain and smart contracts.
- Buy-in from key stakeholders.

---

## 2. Foundation Architecture Design

**Actions:**
- Map out the core Azure architecture (landing zones, policies, RBAC, networking).
- Integrate blockchain-specific requirements (network topology, node security, consensus mechanisms).
- Select blockchain technology (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger) and smart contract languages (e.g., Solidity).

**Pain Points:**
- Ensuring governance policies don’t conflict with blockchain decentralization.
- Balancing flexibility for smart contracts with security controls.

**Outcomes:**
- Reference architecture diagrams.
- Governance blueprint tailored to blockchain.

---

## 3. Laying Out Blockchain Infrastructure

**Actions:**
- Use Template Specs and Deployment Stacks to automate deployment of blockchain networks (e.g., Azure Blockchain Service, VM-based networks).
- Define reusable modules for common blockchain components (nodes, explorers, APIs).
- Enforce policies for blockchain deployments (network isolation, key management).

**Pain Points:**
- Complexity of multi-tenant blockchain environments.
- Automating secure and repeatable deployments.

**Outcomes:**
- Automated, policy-compliant blockchain environments.
- Documentation of deployment stacks for blockchain use cases.

---

## 4. Enabling Smart Contract Development

**Actions:**
- Provide development environments and CI/CD pipelines for smart contracts using Infrastructure-as-Code.
- Integrate security and compliance checks for smart contract code (linting, static analysis).
- Set up test networks and sandboxes for contract validation.

**Pain Points:**
- Onboarding developers to enterprise-secured environments.
- Balancing agility in smart contract iteration with governance requirements.

**Outcomes:**
- Developer-ready environments for secure smart contract development.
- Pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

---

## 5. Governance, Monitoring & Continuous Improvement

**Actions:**
- Implement monitoring and alerting for blockchain operations and contract execution.
- Collect feedback from users and iterate on architecture and templates.
- Keep up to date with Azure and blockchain platform updates.

**Pain Points:**
- Evolving compliance requirements.
- Keeping foundation architecture in sync with business needs and technology changes.

**Outcomes:**
- Continuous improvement of governance foundation.
- Streamlined, compliant smart contract delivery lifecycle.

## Visual Summary (Suggested for Diagrams)

1. **Plan:** Assess needs → Identify stakeholders → Define governance objectives  
2. **Design:** Architect Azure foundation → Integrate blockchain components  
3. **Deploy:** Automate blockchain infrastructure with Template Specs & Stacks  
4. **Develop:** Enable smart contract development with secure CI/CD  
5. **Operate:** Monitor, govern, and iterate
