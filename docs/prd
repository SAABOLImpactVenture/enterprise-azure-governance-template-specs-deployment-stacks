# Product Requirement Document (PRD)

## Title
Enterprise Azure Governance Template Specs & Deployment Stacks with Blockchain Integration

## Overview
This product empowers Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) teams to enforce cloud governance and compliance across Azure tenants using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), CI/CD, automation, and integrated blockchain/smart contract components. It facilitates the migration from Azure Blueprints to Template Specs and Deployment Stacksâ€”adding blockchain for enhanced auditability and trust.

## Goals

- Enable standardized, self-service governance across multiple Azure tenants.
- Automate policy, compliance, and resource deployment using Bicep, PowerShell, and Shell scripts.
- Integrate blockchain and smart contracts for tamper-proof governance records and automated compliance.
- Support extensibility for future governance, compliance, and audit requirements.

## Features

### 1. Template Specs & Deployment Stacks

- Author and publish reusable ARM templates with Bicep.
- Use Template Specs for consistent governance deployments.
- Manage deployments at scale using Deployment Stacks across subscriptions and tenants.

### 2. Governance & Compliance Automation

- Enforce Azure Policies and RBAC.
- CI/CD pipelines for deployment and policy compliance automation.
- Reporting and alerting for non-compliance events.

### 3. Blockchain & Smart Contract Integration

- Record governance actions (policy applications, deployments, compliance events) on a blockchain ledger.
- Implement smart contracts (Solidity) for:
  - Compliance attestation
  - Policy versioning and change tracking
  - Approval workflows for critical governance changes
- Ensure all governance actions are immutable and auditable via blockchain.

### 4. Extensibility & Developer Experience

- Modular design for adding governance modules or new smart contracts.
- Documentation and code samples for integration and customization.

## Non-Goals

- Managing resources outside Azure.
- Building new blockchain platforms (the system will use Ethereum or compatible networks).

## User Stories

- As a CCoE architect, I can deploy governance templates across Azure tenants using a unified workflow.
- As a compliance officer, I can view an immutable blockchain audit trail of all governance actions.
- As a DevOps engineer, I can automate deployment and compliance via CI/CD pipelines.
- As a security auditor, I can verify policy changes and deployments using smart contract logs.

## Technical Requirements

- **Languages:** Bicep, PowerShell, Shell, JavaScript, Solidity
- **Blockchain:** Integrate with Ethereum or EVM-compatible blockchain.
- **Smart Contracts:** 
  - Written in Solidity
  - Emit events for governance actions
  - Functions for attestation, versioning, and approvals
- **CI/CD:** Use GitHub Actions for automation.
- **Documentation:** Deployment, blockchain integration, and smart contract guides.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can deploy template specs and stacks via IaC with minimal manual steps.
- Governance actions are logged on blockchain and verifiable.
- Smart contracts automate compliance attestation and approvals.
- Complete documentation for governance and blockchain integration.

## Out of Scope

- On-premises resource governance
- Direct support for non-Azure clouds
